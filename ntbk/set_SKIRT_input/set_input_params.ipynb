    "# Defining input parameters for a SKIRT simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Alejandro Guzman-Ortega\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code defines the most relevant input parameters for a SKIRT\n",
    "simulation, formatting them in a template `.ski` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that the input particle data (`stars.dat`and `dust.dat`) are\n",
    "already available in the working directory, if not, take a look at \n",
    "`data_reduction.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The template files were initially obtained with the SKIRT QA process and then\n",
    "edited to have placeholders of the form `parameter='{parameter}'` for the\n",
    "parameters that are to be set by the user. These are meant to be general-purpose\n",
    "templates for simulations of FIRE2 galaxies, avoiding the need to create a\n",
    "`.ski` file from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    " The main components of the templates are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `simulationMode` that is either `ExtinctionOnly` or `DustEmission`. For the\n",
    "  latter case, secondary emission is not iterated over.\n",
    "- A `Starburst99SEDFamily` for the stellar particles and a MW-like\n",
    "  `WeingartnerDraineDustMix` for the medium.\n",
    "- A `VoronoiMeshMedium` component for the dust distribution, along with a\n",
    "  `VoronoiMeshSpatialGrid` for discretization of the dust distribution. For the\n",
    "  latter case, the `policy` parameter is set to `ImportedSites` (which are taken\n",
    "  from the positions set in the `dust.dat` file). Effectively this converts the gas particle data into a Voronoi tesselation grid as opposed to an octotree grid being fit to the particle data which has lower convergence.\n",
    "- The instruments are SED + photometric images. For the `ExtinctionOnly` simulation mode the images are common UV to optical broad bands, while the `DustEmission` simulation mode includes IR broad bands. Check the list of `<BroadBand bandName=\"GALEX_GALEX_NUV\"/>` in each template ski file for the exacy list of broad bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Default paramaters for everything else. \n"

    "## What you need to know/set before running the main function\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the main function, you need to set some variables. These are:\n",
    "- `snapnum`: The snapshot number of the FIRE2 object, used to infer the\n",
    "  corresponding redshift.\n",
    "- `simulation_object`: The simulation object name, used to set the appropriate\n",
    "    cosmology parameters.\n",
    "- `mass_fraction`: Set to 1 if you are directly importing dust mass from a simulation (i.e. the FIRE+dust sims from Caleb Choban). If you are not importing a dust mass this represents the fraction of metal mass to assume in dust (i.e. a dust-to-metals ratio MW~0.4). The exact equation SKIRT uses is dust mass = gas mass * metallicity * mass_fraction. \n",
    "- `pixel_scale`: The desired pixel scale for the SKIRT simulation, in arcseconds\n",
    "  per pixel. I recommend to set this parameter to match the scale of the\n",
    "  instrument you plan to compare with from the beginning.\n",
    "- `ski_template_filepath`: The path to the SKIRT template file. \n",
    "- `skirt_sim_mode`: The SKIRT simulation mode. This is either `'dust_emission'`\n",
    "  or `'extinction_only'`. \n",
    "- `output_path`: The path to the output file, typically located within the run directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numpackets`: The number of photon packets to be used in the simulation.\n",
    "- `num_wavelengths`: The number of wavelengths points to be used in the\n",
    "  instruments. This number is only set to SED instruments.\n",
    "- `min_wavelength` and `max_wavelength` are the minimum and maximum wavelengths\n",
    "  to be used in the simulation instruments, in microns and in the frame of the\n",
    "  observer. Again, these are used to  set limits to SED instruments, but the\n",
    "  minimum value also sets the minimum wavelength for the sources. Note that\n",
    "  these values are set in the frame of the observer.\n",
    "- `half_fov_kpc`: The half field of view of the simulation, in kpc. This is used to\n",
    "  set the size of the simulation box, as well as the size of the image.\n"

    "## Other relevant notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### About wavelength ranges/grids\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum wavelength for the sources is set to **120.0 microns**, which is\n",
    "fine since the overall wavelength range extends up to **2000.0 microns** for the\n",
    "SED instruments. As a general rule, avoid launching photon packets with\n",
    "wavelengths that won't be recorded by any instrument. Depending on the\n",
    "instruments or filters being used, the wavelength range should be set\n",
    "appropriately. Also, note that the initial limits are defined in the\n",
    "**observer's frame**. For sources, these limits should be converted to the\n",
    "**rest-frame** to properly sample the desired part of the spectrum. More on this\n",
    "can be found in the [SKIRT documentation on wavelength\n",
    "configuration](https://skirt.ugent.be/root/_user_wave_configure.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The pixel scale and FOV\n",
    "\n",
    "Although resampling to a desired pixel scale is possible after the simulation, I\n",
    "recommend to set the pixel scale from the beginning, especially if you are\n",
    "planning to compare with observations. Regarding the half-FOV, setting this\n",
    "value to a multiple of the half-mass radius would be fine in most cases, as it\n",
    "will capture the object well and avoid unnecessary large images. Values between\n",
    "7.5 and 9.0 have worked well for me in the past. Note that higher resolution pixels \n",
    "will require higher photon numbers for proper convergence at the galaxy edge.\n",
    "Check out the SKIRT [documentation](https://skirt.ugent.be/root/_user_statistics.html])\n",
    "for reliability statistics. \n",
    "However this is not a strict requirement since it depends on your science case. For example,\n",
    "the addition of background noise in post-processing can make these pixels below a real \n",
    "instruments signal-to-noise threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instruments and probes\n",
    "\n",
    "The templates include several instruments, both SED-only and Full (SED + image).\n",
    "For some instruments, the distance is set to zero, which places them in the\n",
    "observer frame at the redshift specified for the object (check [this section of\n",
    "the docs](https://skirt.ugent.be/skirt9/class_distant_instrument.html)). In the\n",
    "case of Full instruments, the wavelength range is defined using a set of\n",
    "broadband filters. I've the full set of filters that\n",
    "can be used with SKIRT (along with their corresponding pivot wavelengths) can be found [in this section of the docs](https://skirt.ugent.be/skirt9/class_broad_band.html). You\n",
    "can also define custom filters, though they must follow a specific format (see\n",
    "[this\n",
    "section](https://skirt.ugent.be/skirt9/class_band.html#aec9dc7f74ddb47745115f4e031cff6b8)).\n",
    "Regarding the probes, these are used to sample/visualize the physical components\n",
    "of a given simulation (e.g. density, temperature). The templates also include a\n",
    "set of these that I consider can be of interest. These are optional and can be\n",
    "removed if not needed, as they are not part of the main simulation output. The\n",
    "only one I recommend keeping is the `ConvergenceInfoProbe`, which reports the\n",
    "convergence information of the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### PAH Emission and High-z Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "The default parameters in the template ski files are not set up for PAH emissions or high-z observations. This simulation assumes equilibrium thermal emission for grains `dustEmissionType=\"Equilibrium\"` which only true for larger grains. PAHs are never in thermal equilibrium due to their small size so you will want to set this to nonequilibrium. For high-z observations, dust heating due to the CMB should be considered so you will want to set `includeHeatingByCMB=\"true\"`."
